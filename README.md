## Overview
Open set recognition (OSR) requires models to classify known samples while detecting unknowns. Current methods use auxiliary datasets to regularize OSR models but are sensitive to outlier selection. We propose a new perspective: **Can we regularize OSR models without carefully chosen outliers?** Our analysis reveals that: 

1) Correlated backgrounds mislead models on 'partially' known images; 

2) Unrelated backgrounds can serve as natural outliers. 

Based on this, we propose **Background Mix (BackMix)**, which mixes image foregrounds (estimated via CAMs) with random backgrounds to break fore-background correlations. This simple yet effective method improves OSR performance without inference overhead and integrates easily with existing frameworks.


## Background Mix (BackMix)
BackMix first **estimates and masks the foreground of the background image**, then randomly **cuts patches and pastes them on the target image** to obtain the mixed image as the training sample.

## Dependencies
We train our models under ```python=3.8, pytorch=1.11, cuda=11.8```. Other versions might be available as well.

1. Install Pytorch and torchvision. Follow the instruction on https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
```sh
# an example:
conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision
```

2. Install other needed packages (numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)
